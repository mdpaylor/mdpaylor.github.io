            As the little prince dropped off to sleep, I took him in my arms and set out walking once more. <span class="underline">I felt deeply moved,
            and stirred. It seemed to me that I was carrying a very fragile treasure.</span> <span class="highlighter">It seemed to me, even, that there was nothing
            more fragile on all Earth. </span>In the moonlight I looked at his pale forehead, his closed eyes, his locks of hair that trembled
            in the wind, and I said to myself: <span class="redBold">"What I see here is nothing but a shell. What is most important is invisible...‚Äù</span>
            As his lips opened slightly with the suspicion of a half-smile, I said to myself, again: <span class="redBold">"What moves me so deeply, about
            this little prince who is sleeping here, is his loyalty to a flower--the image of a rose that shines though his whole being
            like the flame of a lamp, even when he is asleep..."</span> And I felt him to be more fragile still. <span class="underline">I felt the need of protecting
            him, as if he himself were a flame that might be extinguished by a little puff of wind...</span>
